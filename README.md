## Desired population density

_Note: will want to reproduce this section somewhere in the report_
_TODO: get a reference for the <1 /km^2 statistic_

The desired population density to enable natural regeneration without deer fencing is <1 individual per square kilometer (<1 per 100Hectares). The Blackmount DMG has a total area of ~91,000 hectares (910 km^2), with the latest count having ~8500 deer, or ~9/km^2. The desired population is <910 deer.

We can use the model to answer the following questions:

1. How long would it take for the population to get down to this level at current culling levels?
2. What culling strategy would be required to get to this level over 10 years?
3. What culling strategy would be required to keep the population stable at this level?

NaÃ¯ve approach:

- Culling strategy as a set number of individuals each year

More sophisticated approach:

- Culling strategy as a % of individuals each year
- This is probably more useful since it will get increasingly difficult to harvest the same number of individuals
